# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the [Product preview card component](https://frontendmentor.io/coding-challenges/product-preview-card-component) coding challenge. I did this while trying to use the BEM methodology to make the code more readable. I had a lot of fun doing it and I think there are still some parts that I can improve upon, but overall I learned a lot!
